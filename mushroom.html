                <h2> Etymology</h2><br>

                Amanita muscaria, the most easily recognised "toadstool", is frequently depicted in fairy stories and on
                greeting cards. It is often associated with gnomes.<br>
                The terms "mushroom" and "toadstool" go back centuries and were never precisely defined, nor was there
                consensus on application. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the terms mushrom, mushrum, muscheron,
                mousheroms, mussheron, or musserouns were used. <br>

                The term "mushroom" and its variations may have been derived from the French word mousseron in reference
                to moss (mousse). Delineation between edible and poisonous fungi is not clear-cut, so a "mushroom" may
                be edible, poisonous, or unpalatable.<br>

                Cultural or social phobias of mushrooms and fungi may be related. The term "fungophobia" was coined by
                William Delisle Hay of England, who noted a national superstition or fear of "toadstools".<br>

                The word "toadstool" has apparent analogies in Dutch padde(n)stoel (toad-stool/chair, mushroom) and
                German Krötenschwamm (toad-fungus, alt. word for panther cap). In German folklore and old fairy tales,
                toads are often depicted sitting on toadstool mushrooms and catching, with their tongues, the flies that
                are said to be drawn to the Fliegenpilz, a German name for the toadstool, meaning "flies' mushroom".
                This is how the mushroom got another of its names, Krötenstuhl (a less-used German name for the
                mushroom), literally translating to "toad-stool".<br>

                <h3>Identification</h3><br>

                Morphological characteristics of the caps of mushrooms<br>
                Identifying mushrooms requires a basic understanding of their macroscopic structure. Most are
                Basidiomycetes and gilled. Their spores, called basidiospores, are produced on the gills and fall in a
                fine rain of powder from under the caps as a result. At the microscopic level, the basidiospores are
                shot off basidia and then fall between the gills in the dead air space. As a result, for most mushrooms,
                if the cap is cut off and placed gill-side-down overnight, a powdery impression reflecting the shape of
                the gills (or pores, or spines, etc.) is formed (when the fruit body is sporulating). The color of the
                powdery print, called a spore print, is used to help classify mushrooms and can help to identify them.
                Spore print colors include white (most common), brown, black, purple-brown, pink, yellow, and creamy,
                but almost never blue, green, or red.<br>

                While modern identification of mushrooms is quickly becoming molecular, the standard methods for
                identification are still used by most and have developed into a fine art harking back to medieval times
                and the Victorian era, combined with microscopic examination. The presence of juices upon breaking,
                bruising reactions, odors, tastes, shades of color, habitat, habit, and season are all considered by
                both amateur and professional mycologists. Tasting and smelling mushrooms carries its own hazards
                because of poisons and allergens. Chemical tests are also used for some genera.<br>

                In general, identification to genus can often be accomplished in the field using a local mushroom guide.
                Identification to species, however, requires more effort; one must remember that a mushroom develops
                from a button stage into a mature structure, and only the latter can provide certain characteristics
                needed for the identification of the species. However, over-mature specimens lose features and cease
                producing spores. Many novices have mistaken humid water marks on paper for white spore prints, or
                discolored paper from oozing liquids on lamella edges for colored spored prints.<br>

                <h3>Classification</h3><br>
                Main articles: Sporocarp (fungi), Basidiocarp, and Ascocarp <br>

                A mushroom (probably Russula brevipes) parasitized by Hypomyces lactifluorum resulting in a "lobster
                mushroom".
                Typical mushrooms are the fruit bodies of members of the order Agaricales, whose type genus is Agaricus
                and type species is the field mushroom, Agaricus campestris. However, in modern molecularly defined
                classifications, not all members of the order Agaricales produce mushroom fruit bodies, and many other
                gilled fungi, collectively called mushrooms, occur in other orders of the class Agaricomycetes. For
                example, chanterelles are in the Cantharellales, false chanterelles such as Gomphus are in the
                Gomphales, milk-cap mushrooms (Lactarius, Lactifluus) and russulas (Russula), as well as Lentinellus,
                are in the Russulales, while the tough, leathery genera Lentinus and Panus are among the Polyporales,
                but Neolentinus is in the Gloeophyllales, and the little pin-mushroom genus, Rickenella, along with
                similar genera, are in the Hymenochaetales.<br>

                Within the main body of mushrooms, in the Agaricales, are common fungi like the common fairy-ring
                mushroom, shiitake, enoki, oyster mushrooms, fly agarics and other Amanitas, magic mushrooms like
                species of Psilocybe, paddy straw mushrooms, shaggy manes, etc.<br>

                An atypical mushroom is the lobster mushroom, which is a deformed, cooked-lobster-colored parasitized
                fruitbody of a Russula or Lactarius, colored and deformed by the mycoparasitic Ascomycete Hypomyces
                lactifluorum.<br>

                Other mushrooms are not gilled, so the term "mushroom" is loosely used, and giving a full account of
                their classifications is difficult. Some have pores underneath (and are usually called boletes), others
                have spines, such as the hedgehog mushroom and other tooth fungi, and so on. "Mushroom" has been used
                for polypores, puffballs, jelly fungi, coral fungi, bracket fungi, stinkhorns, and cup fungi. Thus, the
                term is more one of common application to macroscopic fungal fruiting bodies than one having precise
                taxonomic meaning. Approximately 14,000 species of mushrooms are described.<br>

                <h3>Morphology</h3><br>
                Amanita jacksonii buttons emerging from their universal veils<br>

                The blue gills of Lactarius indigo, a milk-cap mushroom<br>
                A mushroom develops from a nodule, or pinhead, less than two millimeters in diameter, called a
                primordium, which is typically found on or near the surface of the substrate. It is formed within the
                mycelium, the mass of threadlike hyphae that make up the fungus. The primordium enlarges into a roundish
                structure of interwoven hyphae roughly resembling an egg, called a "button". The button has a cottony
                roll of mycelium, the universal veil, that surrounds the developing fruit body. As the egg expands, the
                universal veil ruptures and may remain as a cup, or volva, at the base of the stalk, or as warts or
                volval patches on the cap. Many mushrooms lack a universal veil, therefore they do not have either a
                volva or volval patches. Often, a second layer of tissue, the partial veil, covers the bladelike gills
                that bear spores. As the cap expands, the veil breaks, and remnants of the partial veil may remain as a
                ring, or annulus, around the middle of the stalk or as fragments hanging from the margin of the cap. The
                ring may be skirt-like as in some species of Amanita, collar-like as in many species of Lepiota, or
                merely the faint remnants of a cortina (a partial veil composed of filaments resembling a spiderweb),
                which is typical of the genus Cortinarius. Mushrooms lacking partial veils do not form an annulus.<br>

                The stalk (also called the stipe, or stem) may be central and support the cap in the middle, or it may
                be off-center and/or lateral, as in species of Pleurotus and Panus. In other mushrooms, a stalk may be
                absent, as in the polypores that form shelf-like brackets. Puffballs lack a stalk, but may have a
                supporting base. Other mushrooms, such as truffles, jellies, earthstars, and bird's nests, usually do
                not have stalks, and a specialized mycological vocabulary exists to describe their parts.<br>

                The way the gills attach to the top of the stalk is an important feature of mushroom morphology.
                Mushrooms in the genera Agaricus, Amanita, Lepiota and Pluteus, among others, have free gills that do
                not extend to the top of the stalk. Others have decurrent gills that extend down the stalk, as in the
                genera Omphalotus and Pleurotus. There are a great number of variations between the extremes of free and
                decurrent, collectively called attached gills. Finer distinctions are often made to distinguish the
                types of attached gills: adnate gills, which adjoin squarely to the stalk; notched gills, which are
                notched where they join the top of the stalk; adnexed gills, which curve upward to meet the stalk, and
                so on. These distinctions between attached gills are sometimes difficult to interpret, since gill
                attachment may change as the mushroom matures, or with different environmental conditions.<br>

                <h3>Microscopic features</h3><br>

                Morchella elata asci viewed with phase contrast microscopy<br>
                A hymenium is a layer of microscopic spore-bearing cells that covers the surface of gills. In the
                nongilled mushrooms, the hymenium lines the inner surfaces of the tubes of boletes and polypores, or
                covers the teeth of spine fungi and the branches of corals. In the Ascomycota, spores develop within
                microscopic elongated, sac-like cells called asci, which typically contain eight spores in each ascus.
                The Discomycetes, which contain the cup, sponge, brain, and some club-like fungi, develop an exposed
                layer of asci, as on the inner surfaces of cup fungi or within the pits of morels. The Pyrenomycetes,
                tiny dark-colored fungi that live on a wide range of substrates including soil, dung, leaf litter, and
                decaying wood, as well as other fungi, produce minute, flask-shaped structures called perithecia, within
                which the asci develop.<br>

                In the Basidiomycetes, usually four spores develop on the tips of thin projections called sterigmata,
                which extend from club-shaped cells called a basidia. The fertile portion of the Gasteromycetes, called
                a gleba, may become powdery as in the puffballs or slimy as in the stinkhorns. Interspersed among the
                asci are threadlike sterile cells called paraphyses. Similar structures called cystidia often occur
                within the hymenium of the Basidiomycota. Many types of cystidia exist, and assessing their presence,
                shape, and size is often used to verify the identification of a mushroom.<br>

                The most important microscopic feature for identification of mushrooms is the spores. Their color,
                shape, size, attachment, ornamentation, and reaction to chemical tests often can be the crux of an
                identification. A spore often has a protrusion at one end, called an apiculus, which is the point of
                attachment to the basidium, termed the apical germ pore, from which the hypha emerges when the spore
                germinates.<br>

                <h3>Growth</h3><br>

                Agaricus bitorquis mushroom emerging through asphalt concrete in summer<br>
                Many species of mushrooms seemingly appear overnight, growing or expanding rapidly. This phenomenon is
                the source of several common expressions in the English language including "to mushroom" or
                "mushrooming" (expanding rapidly in size or scope) and "to pop up like a mushroom" (to appear
                unexpectedly and quickly). In reality, all species of mushrooms take several days to form primordial
                mushroom fruit bodies, though they do expand rapidly by the absorption of fluids.[citation needed]<br>

                The cultivated mushroom, as well as the common field mushroom, initially form a minute fruiting body,
                referred to as the pin stage because of their small size. Slightly expanded, they are called buttons,
                once again because of the relative size and shape. Once such stages are formed, the mushroom can rapidly
                pull in water from its mycelium and expand, mainly by inflating preformed cells that took several days
                to form in the primordia.[citation needed]<br>

                Similarly, there are other mushrooms, like Parasola plicatilis (formerly Coprinus plicatlis), that grow
                rapidly overnight and may disappear by late afternoon on a hot day after rainfall.[13] The primordia
                form at ground level in lawns in humid spaces under the thatch and after heavy rainfall or in dewy
                conditions balloon to full size in a few hours, release spores, and then collapse. They "mushroom" to
                full size.[citation needed]<br>

                Not all mushrooms expand overnight; some grow very slowly and add tissue to their fruiting bodies by
                growing from the edges of the colony or by inserting hyphae. For example, Pleurotus nebrodensis grows
                slowly, and because of this combined with human collection, it is now critically endangered.<br>


                Yellow flower pot mushrooms (Leucocoprinus birnbaumii) at various states of development<br>
                Though mushroom fruiting bodies are short-lived, the underlying mycelium can itself be long-lived and
                massive. A colony of Armillaria solidipes (formerly known as Armillaria ostoyae) in Malheur National
                Forest in the United States is estimated to be 2,400 years old, possibly older, and spans an estimated
                2,200 acres (8.9 km2).[15] Most of the fungus is underground and in decaying wood or dying tree roots in
                the form of white mycelia combined with black shoelace-like rhizomorphs that bridge colonized separated
                woody substrates.<br>

                Raw brown mushrooms are 92% water, 4% carbohydrates, 2% protein and less than 1% fat. In a 100 gram (3.5
                ounce) amount, raw mushrooms provide 22 calories and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value,
                DV) of B vitamins, such as riboflavin, niacin and pantothenic acid, selenium (37% DV) and copper (25%
                DV), and a moderate source (10-19% DV) of phosphorus, zinc and potassium (table). They have minimal or
                no vitamin C and sodium content.<br>

                <h3>Vitamin D</h3><br>
                The vitamin D content of a mushroom depends on postharvest handling, in particular the unintended
                exposure to sunlight. The US Department of Agriculture provided evidence that UV-exposed mushrooms
                contain substantial amounts of vitamin D.[17] When exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light, even after
                harvesting,[18] ergosterol in mushrooms is converted to vitamin D2,[19] a process now used intentionally
                to supply fresh vitamin D mushrooms for the functional food grocery market.[20] In a comprehensive
                safety assessment of producing vitamin D in fresh mushrooms, researchers showed that artificial UV light
                technologies were equally effective for vitamin D production as in mushrooms exposed to natural
                sunlight, and that UV light has a long record of safe use for production of vitamin D in food. <br>
