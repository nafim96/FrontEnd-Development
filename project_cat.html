                The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.<br>[1] It is the only
                domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to
                distinguish
                it from the wild members of the family.<br>[3] A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral
                cat;
                the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.<br>[4] Domestic cats are valued by humans for
                companionship and their ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat
                registries.<br>[5]

                The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick
                reflexes,
                sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell
                are
                well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing,
                growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. It is a solitary hunter but a social
                species. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by
                mice and other small mammals. It is a predator that is most active at dawn and dusk.<br>[6] It secretes
                and
                perceives pheromones.<br>[7]

                Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from
                two to five kittens.<br>[8] Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a
                hobby
                known as cat fancy. Failure to control breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering, as well as
                abandonment of pets, resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the
                extinction
                of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species, and evoking population control.<br>[9]

                Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC.<br>[10] It was long thought that cat
                domestication was initiated in Ancient Egypt, as since around 3100 BC veneration was given to cats in
                ancient Egypt.<br>
                [11]

                As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States by number of pets
                owned, after freshwater fish, with 95 million cats owned.<br>[12] In the United Kingdom, around
                7.3
                million cats lived in more than 4.8 million households as of 2019.
