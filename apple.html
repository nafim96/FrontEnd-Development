                <h3>Etymology</h3><br>
                The word "apple", formerly spelled æppel in Old English, is derived from the Proto-Germanic root
                *ap(a)laz, which could also mean fruit in general. This is ultimately derived from Proto-Indo-European
                *ab(e)l-, but the precise original meaning and the relationship between both words is uncertain.<br>

                As late as the 17th century, the word also functioned as a generic term for all fruit other than berries
                but including nuts—such as the 14th century Middle English word appel of paradis, meaning a banana.
                This use is analogous to the French language use of pomme.<br>

                <h3>Description</h3><br>

                Blossoms, fruits, and leaves of the apple tree (Malus domestica)<br>

                An apple's side, stem end, and interior<br>
                The apple is a deciduous tree, generally standing 2 to 4.5 m (6 to 15 ft) tall in cultivation and up to
                9 m (30 ft) in the wild. When cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined by rootstock
                selection and trimming method. The leaves are alternately arranged dark green-colored simple ovals with
                serrated margins and slightly downy undersides.<br>


                <h3>Apple blossom</h3><br>
                Blossoms are produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves and are produced on spurs
                and some long shoots. The 3 to 4 cm (1 to 1 1⁄2 in) flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually
                fades, five petaled, with an inflorescence consisting of a cyme with 4–6 flowers. The central flower of
                the inflorescence is called the "king bloom"; it opens first and can develop a larger fruit.
                <br>
                The fruit matures in late summer or autumn, and cultivars exist in a wide range of sizes. Commercial
                growers aim to produce an apple that is 7 to 8.5 cm (2 3⁄4 to 3 1⁄4 in) in diameter, due to market
                preference. Some consumers, especially those in Japan, prefer a larger apple, while apples below 5.5 cm
                (2 1⁄4 in) are generally used for making juice and have little fresh market value. The skin of ripe
                apples is generally red, yellow, green, pink, or russetted, though many bi- or tri-colored cultivars may
                be found.[7] The skin may also be wholly or partly russeted i.e. rough and brown. The skin is covered in
                a protective layer of epicuticular wax.[8] The exocarp (flesh) is generally pale yellowish-white,[7]
                though pink or yellow exocarps also occur.<br>

                <h3>Wild ancestors</h3><br>
                Main article: Malus sieversii
                The original wild ancestor of Malus domestica was Malus sieversii, found growing wild in the mountains
                of Central Asia in southern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Xinjiang, China.[5][9] Cultivation
                of the species, most likely beginning on the forested flanks of the Tian Shan mountains, progressed over
                a long period of time and permitted secondary introgression of genes from other species into the
                open-pollinated seeds. Significant exchange with Malus sylvestris, the crabapple, resulted in current
                populations of apples being more related to crabapples than to the more morphologically similar
                progenitor Malus sieversii. In strains without recent admixture the contribution of the latter
                predominates.<br>

                <h3>Genome</h3><br>
                In 2010, an Italian-led consortium announced they had sequenced the complete genome of the apple in
                collaboration with horticultural genomicists at Washington State University,[13] using 'Golden
                Delicious'.[14] It had about 57,000 genes, the highest number of any plant genome studied to date[15]
                and more genes than the human genome (about 30,000). This new understanding of the apple genome will
                help scientists identify genes and gene variants that contribute to resistance to disease and drought,
                and other desirable characteristics. Understanding the genes behind these characteristics will help
                scientists perform more knowledgeable selective breeding. The genome sequence also provided proof that
                Malus sieversii was the wild ancestor of the domestic apple—an issue that had been long-debated in the
                scientific community.<br>

                Malus sieversii is recognized as a major progenitor species to the cultivated apple, and is
                morphologically similar. Due to the genetic variability in Central Asia, this region is generally
                considered the center of origin for apples.[17] The apple is thought to have been domesticated
                4000-10000 years ago in the Tian Shan Mountains, and then to have travelled along the Silk Road to
                Europe, with hybridization and introgression of wild crabapples from Siberia (M. baccata (L.) Borkh.),
                Caucasus (M. orientalis Uglitz.), and Europe (M. sylvestris Mill.). Only the M. sieversii trees growing
                on the western side of Tian Shan Mountains contributed genetically to the domesticated apple, not the
                isolated population on the eastern side.
                <br>
                Chinese soft apples, such as M. asiatica and M. prunifolia, have been cultivated as dessert apples for
                more than 2000 years in China. These are thought to be hybrids between M. baccata and M. sieversii in
                Kazakhstan.
                <br>
                Among the traits selected for by human growers are size, fruit acidity, color, firmness, and soluble
                sugar. Unusually for domesticated fruits, the wild M. sieversii origin is only slightly smaller than the
                modern domesticated apple.<br> [18]

                At the Sammardenchia-Cueis site near Udine in Northeastern Italy, seeds from some form of apples have
                been found in material carbon dated to around 4000 BCE.[19] Genetic analysis has not yet been
                successfully used to determine whether such ancient apples were wild Malus Sylvestris or Malus
                Domesticus containing Malus sieversii ancestry.<br> [20] It is generally also hard to distinguish in the
                archeological record between foraged wild apples and apple plantations.

                There is indirect evidence of apple cultivation in the third millennium BCE in the Middle East. There
                was substantial apple production in the European classical antiquity, and grafting was certainly known
                then.[20] Grafting is an essential part of modern domesticated apple production, to be able to propagate
                the best cultivars; it is unclear when apple tree grafting was invented.[20]

                Winter apples, picked in late autumn and stored just above freezing, have been an important food in Asia
                and Europe for millennia.[21] Of the many Old World plants that the Spanish introduced to Chiloé
                Archipelago in the 16th century, apple trees became particularly well adapted.[22] Apples were
                introduced to North America by colonists in the 17th century,[5] and the first apple orchard on the
                North American continent was planted in Boston by Reverend William Blaxton in 1625.[23] The only apples
                native to North America are crab apples, which were once called "common apples".[24] Apple cultivars
                brought as seed from Europe were spread along Native American trade routes, as well as being cultivated
                on colonial farms. An 1845 United States apples nursery catalogue sold 350 of the "best" cultivars,
                showing the proliferation of new North American cultivars by the early 19th century.[24] In the 20th
                century, irrigation projects in Eastern Washington began and allowed the development of the
                multibillion-dollar fruit industry, of which the apple is the leading product.[5]

                Until the 20th century, farmers stored apples in frostproof cellars during the winter for their own use
                or for sale. Improved transportation of fresh apples by train and road replaced the necessity for
                storage.[25][26] Controlled atmosphere facilities are used to keep apples fresh year-round. Controlled
                atmosphere facilities use high humidity, low oxygen, and controlled carbon dioxide levels to maintain
                fruit freshness. They were first used in the United States in the 1960s.[27]

                <h3>Society and culture</h3><br>
                Main article: Apple (symbolism)<br>
                Germanic paganism<br>
                Illustration of girl in a red dress, holding 3 candles in one hand and a basket of apples in the other
                "Brita as Iduna" (1901) by Carl Larsson
                In Norse mythology, the goddess Iðunn is portrayed in the Prose Edda (written in the 13th century by
                Snorri Sturluson) as providing apples to the gods that give them eternal youthfulness. English scholar
                H. R. Ellis Davidson links apples to religious practices in Germanic paganism, from which Norse paganism
                developed. She points out that buckets of apples were found in the Oseberg ship burial site in Norway,
                that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in Skáldskaparmál) have
                been found in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England and elsewhere on the continent of
                Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of fertility
                in southwest England.[28]
                <br>
                Davidson notes a connection between apples and the Vanir, a tribe of gods associated with fertility in
                Norse mythology, citing an instance of eleven "golden apples" being given to woo the beautiful Gerðr by
                Skírnir, who was acting as messenger for the major Vanir god Freyr in stanzas 19 and 20 of Skírnismál.
                Davidson also notes a further connection between fertility and apples in Norse mythology in chapter 2 of
                the Völsunga saga when the major goddess Frigg sends King Rerir an apple after he prays to Odin for a
                child, Frigg's messenger (in the guise of a crow) drops the apple in his lap as he sits atop a
                mound.[29] Rerir's wife's consumption of the apple results in a six-year pregnancy and the Caesarean
                section birth of their son—the hero Völsung.[30]
                <br>
                Further, Davidson points out the "strange" phrase "Apples of Hel" used in an 11th-century poem by the
                skald Thorbiorn Brúnarson. She states this may imply that the apple was thought of by Brúnarson as the
                food of the dead. Further, Davidson notes that the potentially Germanic goddess Nehalennia is sometimes
                depicted with apples and that parallels exist in early Irish stories. Davidson asserts that while
                cultivation of the apple in Northern Europe extends back to at least the time of the Roman Empire and
                came to Europe from the Near East, the native varieties of apple trees growing in Northern Europe are
                small and bitter. Davidson concludes that in the figure of Iðunn "we must have a dim reflection of an
                old symbol: that of the guardian goddess of the life-giving fruit of the other world."<br>
                <h3>Greek mythology</h3><br>

                Heracles with the apple of Hesperides
                Apples appear in many religious traditions, often as a mystical or forbidden fruit. One of the problems
                identifying apples in religion, mythology and folktales is that the word "apple" was used as a generic
                term for all (foreign) fruit, other than berries, including nuts, as late as the 17th century.[31] For
                instance, in Greek mythology, the Greek hero Heracles, as a part of his Twelve Labours, was required to
                travel to the Garden of the Hesperides and pick the golden apples off the Tree of Life growing at its
                center.[32][33][34]
                <br>
                The Greek goddess of discord, Eris, became disgruntled after she was excluded from the wedding of Peleus
                and Thetis.[35] In retaliation, she tossed a golden apple inscribed Καλλίστη (Kalliste, sometimes
                transliterated Kallisti, "For the most beautiful one"), into the wedding party. Three goddesses claimed
                the apple: Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. Paris of Troy was appointed to select the recipient. After being
                bribed by both Hera and Athena, Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen
                of Sparta. He awarded the apple to Aphrodite, thus indirectly causing the Trojan War.[36]
                <br>
                The apple was thus considered, in ancient Greece, sacred to Aphrodite. To throw an apple at someone was
                to symbolically declare one's love; and similarly, to catch it was to symbolically show one's acceptance
                of that love. An epigram claiming authorship by Plato states:[37]
                <br>
                I throw the apple at you, and if you are willing to love me, take it and share your girlhood with me;
                but if your thoughts are what I pray they are not, even then take it, and consider how short-lived is
                beauty.
                <br>
                — Plato, Epigram VII<br>
                Atalanta, also of Greek mythology, raced all her suitors in an attempt to avoid marriage. She outran all
                but Hippomenes (also known as Melanion, a name possibly derived from melon the Greek word for both
                "apple" and fruit in general),[33] who defeated her by cunning, not speed. Hippomenes knew that he could
                not win in a fair race, so he used three golden apples (gifts of Aphrodite, the goddess of love) to
                distract Atalanta. It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Hippomenes was finally successful,
                winning the race and Atalanta's hand.<br>

                <h3>Christian art</h3><br>

                Adam and Eve by Albrecht Dürer (1507), showcasing the apple as a symbol of sin.<br>
                Though the forbidden fruit of Eden in the Book of Genesis is not identified, popular Christian tradition
                has held that it was an apple that Eve coaxed Adam to share with her.[38] The origin of the popular
                identification with a fruit unknown in the Middle East in biblical times is found in confusion between
                the Latin words mālum (an apple) and mălum (an evil), each of which is normally written malum.[39] The
                tree of the forbidden fruit is called "the tree of the knowledge of good and evil" in Genesis 2:17, and
                the Latin for "good and evil" is bonum et malum.[40]
                <br>
                Renaissance painters may also have been influenced by the story of the golden apples in the Garden of
                Hesperides. As a result, in the story of Adam and Eve, the apple became a symbol for knowledge,
                immortality, temptation, the fall of man into sin, and sin itself. The larynx in the human throat has
                been called the "Adam's apple" because of a notion that it was caused by the forbidden fruit remaining
                in the throat of Adam.[38] The apple as symbol of sexual seduction has been used to imply human
                sexuality, possibly in an ironic vein.<br>

                <h3>Proverb</h3><br>
                The proverb, "An apple a day keeps the doctor away", addressing the supposed health benefits of the
                fruit, has been traced to 19th-century Wales, where the original phrase was "Eat an apple on going to
                bed, and you'll keep the doctor from earning his bread".[41] In the 19th century and early 20th, the
                phrase evolved to "an apple a day, no doctor to pay" and "an apple a day sends the doctor away"; the
                phrasing now commonly used was first recorded in 1922. Despite the proverb, there is no evidence that
                eating an apple daily has any significant health effects.<br>

                <h3>Cultivars</h3><br>
                Main article: List of apple cultivars<br>
                There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples.[44] Cultivars vary in their yield and the ultimate
                size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock.[45] Different cultivars are available for
                temperate and subtropical climates. The UK's National Fruit Collection, which is the responsibility of
                the Department of Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs, includes a collection of over 2,000 cultivars of
                apple tree in Kent.[46] The University of Reading, which is responsible for developing the UK national
                collection database, provides access to search the national collection. The University of Reading's work
                is part of the European Cooperative Programme for Plant Genetic Resources of which there are 38
                countries participating in the Malus/Pyrus work <br>

                The UK's national fruit collection database contains much information on the characteristics and origin
                of many apples, including alternative names for what is essentially the same "genetic" apple cultivar.
                Most of these cultivars are bred for eating fresh (dessert apples), though some are cultivated
                specifically for cooking (cooking apples) or producing cider. Cider apples are typically too tart and
                astringent to eat fresh, but they give the beverage a rich flavor that dessert apples cannot.<br>
                Commercially popular apple cultivars are soft but crisp. Other desirable qualities in modern commercial
                apple breeding are a colorful skin, absence of russeting, ease of shipping, lengthy storage ability,
                high yields, disease resistance, common apple shape, and developed flavor.[45] Modern apples are
                generally sweeter than older cultivars, as popular tastes in apples have varied over time. Most North
                Americans and Europeans favor sweet, subacid apples, but tart apples have a strong minority
                following.<br>

                Extremely sweet apples with barely any acid flavor are popular in Asia,[49] especially the Indian
                Subcontinent.
                <br>
                Old cultivars are often oddly shaped, russeted, and grow in a variety of textures and colors. Some find
                them to have better flavor than modern cultivars,[50] but they may have other problems that make them
                commercially unviable—low yield, disease susceptibility, poor tolerance for storage or transport, or
                just being the "wrong" size. A few old cultivars are still produced on a large scale, but many have been
                preserved by home gardeners and farmers that sell directly to local markets. Many unusual and locally
                important cultivars with their own unique taste and appearance exist; apple conservation campaigns have
                sprung up around the world to preserve such local cultivars from extinction. In the United Kingdom, old
                cultivars such as 'Cox's Orange Pippin' and 'Egremont Russet' are still commercially important even
                though by modern standards they are low yielding and susceptible to disease.
